# Unity Wear Tool: 3D Garment Design Visualizer Web-App

<img src="./unitywearmain.jpg" width="100%" />

The purpose of this web-app is to simplify the team-wear merchandise design process. 
Most team brands already have a go to logo when it comes to desiging customized annual team wear
such as warmp-up jerseys. Teams often have to approach mediocre graphic designers to come up with a 
new design for their upcoming season. This tool helps automate this process by providing customizable
garment design templates which take in an existing logo, and style it.
